TESTING & DEBUGGING STRATEGY: 
Discuss your strategy for testing & debugging your program.  
What tools did you use (gdb/lldb/Visual Studio debugger,
Valgrind/Dr. Memory, std::cout & print, etc.)?  How did you test the
"corner cases" of your implementation?

I would incementally add in parts of my functions to see if they would compile/work. I tried
using GDB but for some reason it was giving me a lot of trouble. I think I have to try and 
reinstall Ubuntu. Everytime I would create new nodes I would run Valgrind to check for memory 
leaks. I would try to test my corner cases by using lots of assert functions and having my 
functions print out info I thought was useful.
