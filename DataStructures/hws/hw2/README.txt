DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CREATIVE STATISTIC:
Please be concise!

My custom statistic prints out players who made strikes in the game. The first part of
the custom statistic is checking to see if anyone bowled a perfect game, which means
that they made 12 strikes. If someone bowled a perfect game then their name is displayed.
Then my program checks if anyone made and strikes in the game and displays a message
saying that no one made any strikes. If someone or multiple people made strikes during
the game then they get displayed along with how many strikes they made in that game.



MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
Optional, please be concise!

Sorry if my class structure is not easy to read because I was kind
of struggling to figure out how they actually worked and the importance
of public and private variables.
